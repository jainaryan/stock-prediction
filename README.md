Stock Price Prediction using LSTM
This repository contains a Python implementation of a Stock Price Prediction model using LSTM neural networks. The model uses previous closing prices of a stock to predict its future closing prices.

Requirements
1. Python 3.7+
2. TensorFlow
3. Pandas
4. Numpy
5. Matplotlib
6. Jupyter Notebook (for running the example notebook)
   
Results

Summarize the LSTM model's performance and include visualizations of predicted vs. actual stock prices.
