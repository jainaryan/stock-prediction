Stock Price Prediction using LSTM
This repository contains a Python implementation of a Stock Price Prediction model using LSTM neural networks. The model uses previous closing prices of a stock to predict its future closing prices.

Data
Prepare your dataset with historical stock price data containing the Date and Close columns. Ensure data is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets.

Requirements
Python 3.7+
TensorFlow
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook (for running the example notebook)
Results
Summarize the LSTM model's performance and include visualizations of predicted vs. actual stock prices.
